This week's lab work involves hand correction (latest: 06282024/exp5/85 jpg) and new experiment. 
We are starting performing experiment on control group, we are performing experiment with plain 3mm agar patch with the humidty set at 60%.
We need to performed the experiment for 3 times. I have performed the  experiment for 2 times, however, the video was blurred. Therefore will need to redo the experiment again next week. 
Things to be improve for better video quality: tubes needs to be adjust more carfully, peltier needs to be placed carefully so its not tilt, think of a way to hold the peltier more tightly.
