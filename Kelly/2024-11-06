Performing control group experiment using plain agar patch. 
For each video, pick a droplet and use ImageJ to analyze its coordinates in 15 frames to find its maximum displacement due to vibration. 
ImageJ will generate 30 graphs for each droplet being analyzed: 15 graphs for the x-axis and 15 graphs for the y-axis to observe the displacement.
