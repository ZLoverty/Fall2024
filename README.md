# Fall 2024 Reseach Notes

Writing is an important part of research training. After spending time to collect and analyze some data, it is helpful to summarize the results in a written note. This note should consist of

- a brief introduction, which reminds you and other readers why you are doing this research, what specific questions you are trying to answer with this experiment;
- a data visualization, which summarizes the experimental data in plots or other visuals;
- a discussion, which addresses the questions you asked in the introduction using the experimental data.

Once written, this note can serve as the outline for your project meeting presentations. When you are wrapping up the project as a thesis / report / research article, these notes are also invaluable references that can get you started from established thoughts, rather than from scratch.

**Markdown** is a simple and powerful tool for writing research notes. This note, for example, is written in Markdown. The following is a brief introduction to Markdown key features and syntax.

## Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is widely used for documentation, blogging, and writing README files on platforms like GitHub.

### Key Features
- **Easy Formatting**: Create headings, lists, and tables with simple symbols.
- **Inline Code**: Include code snippets using backticks: `code`.
- **Hyperlinks and Images**: Embed links and images with `[link text](url)` and `![alt text](image_url)`.
- **Readable**: Markdown files are easy to read in plain text, making them ideal for writing and note-taking.

### Basic Syntax
#### Headings
Use `#` for headings:
```markdown
# Level 1 header
## Level 2 header
### Level 3 header
```
# Level 1 header
## Level 2 header
### Level 3 header

#### Emphasis
- *italic*: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- **bold**: `**bold**` or `__bold__`
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~Strikethrough~~`

#### Lists
- Unordered: `- Item`
- Ordered: `1. Item`

#### Equations
You can also write equations with $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$

$$
E = m c ^ 2
$$

#### Images
```markdown
![Description of Image](image_url)
```
For example, `![markdown](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)` gives you
